      , DICE GM Oskar Gabrielson cites ongoing complications with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Given the scale
      and scope of the game, we had hoped our teams would be back in our studios together as we move towards launch. With 
      the ongoing conditions not allowing that to happen safely, and with all the hard work the teams are doing from home, 
      we feel it is important to take the extra time to deliver on the vision of Battlefield 2042 for our players.”

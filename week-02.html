          SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule carrying four private citizens plunged through Earth’s atmosphere Saturday
          night and splashed down off the east coast of Florida, closing out the company’s first all-civilian mission
          in space. The Inspiration4 crew — the mission’s billionaire funder Jared Isaacman, geoscientist Sian Proctor,
          physician assistant Haley Arceneaux, and data engineer Chris Sembroski — became the first crew to hang out
          in Earth orbit without any professionally trained astronauts.

          The crew’s splashdown zone in the Atlantic Ocean was roughly 30 miles east of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, 
          where they

            launched to space
          </a> 
          atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday. Beginning at about 7:02PM ET, Crew 
          Dragon deployed two sets of parachutes — an initial set of two, and a final set of four — to ease its descent 
          toward the ocean. Splashdown happened at around 7:06PM ET. SpaceX recovery teams raced toward the capsule in 
          boats to retrieve the crew.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Thanks so much SpaceX, it was a heck of a ride for us, and we’re just getting started” Isaacman told 
          SpaceX’s mission control just after splashing down.

        <p>
          From an on-time launch at 8:02PM ET Wednesday to an on-time splashdown Saturday, the Inspiration4
          mission lasted 71 hours total. The objectives of the orbital trek were two-fold: to raise $200
          million for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a non-profit that researchers cancer and gives free
          care to kids with cancer and other life-threatening diseases, and conduct a scientific study
          on how the passengers’ bodies react to microgravity. Since launching on Wednesday, St. Jude
          raised roughly $20 million, putting the total fundraiser at about $153 million of its $200
          million goal, St. Jude said.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the amateur crew strapped inside, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon began its fully autonomous reentry
          process at around 6:11PM ET, when it ditched its trunk and fired a set of thrusters to lower
          itself out of orbit and toward Earth’s atmosphere. A live video feed from inside the capsule
          showed Sembroski taking advantage of some in-flight entertainment — a movie was playing on an
          iPad strapped to his knee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew’s journey back to Earth appeared uneventful. They went through an expected, roughly
          seven-minute communications blackout with SpaceX’s mission control in California due to the
          sheath of plasma that forms around the capsule during its turbulent atmospheric reentry.
          During reentry, the exterior of the spacecraft reached temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees
          Fahrenheit, but the crew was kept cool by their flight suits and reinforced air conditioning
          inside the capsule. Crew Dragon streaked across the skies above northeast South America and
          zoomed toward the Cape Canaveral coast.
        </p>
        <p>
          An initial set of two parachutes deployed as planned, slowing the capsule from 350 miles per
          hour to 100MPH. Those parachutes were ditched less than a minute later at an altitude of nearly
          1,800ft and replaced by another deployment of four main parachutes, which worked to slow the
          spacecraft down to about 15MPH at splashdown.

        <p>
          The capsule was hoisted out of the water and onto SpaceX’s “Go Searcher” boat roughly a half hour after
          splashing down. After that, recovery teams opened Crew Dragon’s hatch door and guided the crew out on a
          platform one by one, Arceneaux leading the pack. Proctor was next, practically grooving her way onto the
          platform. Sembroski and Isaacman followed. Isaacman’s egress was more of a toddle, his legs shaking a bit
          as he adjusted to Earth’s gravity. They’ll all get checked out by medical personnel and flown in a helicopter
          back to land.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew was in high spirits after stepping out of Crew Dragon, Inspiration4 mission director Scott Poteet told
          reporters during a post-splashdown press conference. “They’re taking selfies, they’re having a good time,
          they’re eating, they’re drinking, standing up and walking around.”

          For the crew’s three-day trip in orbit, roughly 363 miles high, they video chatted with St. Jude
          patients, rang the bell on the New York Stock Exchange, and kept in touch with friends and family.
          Isaacman placed a $4,000 bet to Las Vegas that the Eagles would win the Super Bowl, and at another
          point, remotely chatted with Tom Cruise. They put on
          <a class="links_Text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680152/spacex-inspiration4-first-private-crew-update-in-orbit">
            a brief talent show
          </a>
          on Friday in a livestream update — Sembroski jammed on a ukulele, Proctor showed off a drawing she made
          using a pack of metallic pens, and Arceneaux did somersaults in microgravity. “Hayley is a champ at
          spinning,” Proctor said as Arceneaux curled up in a ball and started tumbling in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew gathered data for a scientific study examining how microgravity affects the human body.
          During Friday’s video, Arceneaux showed off a device the crew was using to measure cranial pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Crew Dragon capsule, named Resilience, was the same spacecraft that 
          <a class="links_Text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa">
            nearly a year ago
          </a>
          sent a four-person crew of government astronauts to the International Space Station 
          <a class="links_Text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22413121/spacex-crew-dragon-resilience-splashdown-nasa-record-iss">
            and back
          </a>
          . Few changes were made to the capsule besides a glass dome that was installed where the capsule’s docking 
          door normally is, giving the passengers a 360-degree view of space while in orbit. The upper half of about 
          three passengers could easily fit inside the dome.

        <div class="article_Quote-Left">

        <p>
          Everything went nearly without a hitch, besides an issue with the capsule’s waste management system, or 
          toilet.That was related to ”an issue with a fan that’s part of the system,” but it was quickly resolved, 
          Inspiration4 mission director Todd Ericson said during a press conference. He did not offer additional details
          of the incident. Another issue during the mission involved a temperature sensor associated with one of Crew 
          Dragon’s thrusters, but a backup sensor kicked in and worked fine, SpaceX’s director of crew mission 
          management Benji Reed said. Overall, it was a “very clean mission from start to finish.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with the mission’s official goals, Inspiration4 also showed that trips to orbit aren’t just for 
          government astronauts anymore. Other missions will follow, including the
          <a class="links_Text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price">
            first private mission to the ISS next year
          </a>
          . The company that brokered that trip, Axiom Space, has already signed up for
          <a class="links_Text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465134/spacex-axiom-space-sign-bulk-deal-private-crew-dragon-missions">
            three additional trips to the ISS
          </a>
           on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon.
        </p>
        <p>“Welcome to the second space age,” Ericson said.</p>
